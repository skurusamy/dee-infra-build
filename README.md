## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dee-infra-build.git
    cd dee-infra-build
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js projects
    npm install
    ```
3. **Run the project:**
     ```bash
        # Start the application in development mode
        npm start
        ```
        - This command will launch the application using the default configuration. If you have environment variables to set, create a `.env` file in the project root or set them in your shell before running the command.
        - For production builds, you may use:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        npm run serve
        ```
        - Refer to the project's documentation for additional scripts or configuration options.

4. **Access the application:**
        - Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` or configuration files).
        - If running in a different environment or port, update the URL accordingly.
        - Check the terminal output for any startup messages or errors.
